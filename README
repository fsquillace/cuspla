NAME
----
cuspla - A  CULA wrapper with a high-level interface for CUSP

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*cuspla* is a CULA wrapper used in CUSP library that allows to detect where 
arrays or matrices are stored (in device or host memory) and the 
precision used (float or double). Doing so, it will call the appropriate
unified function of *cuspla* that will call one of the associated routine 
of CULA. *cuspla* also ease the pain of specify all the parameter
(leading dimension, numb of rows, ...) in CULA routines that are based in
a LAPACK fashion because *cuspla* detect the properties of the matrix directly
from the array2d object of CUSP.

CULA use a column major order of the matrix hence, when using matrix in CUSP 
you have to specify the cusp::column_major order for the matrix.

EXAMPLE OF USING
----------------
For matrix-matrix multiplication::
---------------------------------
#include <cuspla.h>

cusp::array2d<cusp::double, cusp::device_memory, cusp::column_major> A, B, C;
// Filling matrices A and B;
// ....

// C = A*B
cuspla::gemm(A, B, C);

// C = A'*B
cuspla::gemm(A, B, C, true, false);
